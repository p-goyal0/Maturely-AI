          "Initial": "AI projects are experimental pilots, funded separately, with no required link to core business KPIs.",
          "Adopting": "AI projects must articulate a potential business impact, but tracking and accountability are inconsistent.",
          "Established": "Every new AI initiative requires a formal business case linking it to a major KPI (e.g., 5% reduction in churn).",
          "Advanced": "AI project performance is reviewed quarterly by executive leadership against the original business case and KPI targets.",
          "Transformational": "AI impact is integrated into the official financial forecasting/budgeting system and is a mandatory component of multiple departmental strategic plans."

          "Initial": "We are aware of the risks but have no formal policies or review processes in place.",
          "Adopting": "We have a draft document of principles/guidelines, but adherence is voluntary and decentralized.",
          "Established": "We have a formal, documented policy on bias, transparency, and fairness that all AI teams must follow.",
          "Advanced": "A dedicated AI Ethics/Review Board or a similar cross-functional committee must formally approve all models before production deployment.",
          "Transformational": "Responsible AI metrics (e.g., bias auditing, explainability scores) are automatically tracked, monitored in production, and integrated into the model's performance KPIs."

          "Initial": "Deployment is a manual, one-off process handled primarily by the data scientist who built the model.",
          "Adopting": "We use basic scripts/templates, but deployment often requires manual configuration and significant IT involvement.",
          "Established": "We have a standardized CI/CD pipeline (MLOps) for model packaging, testing, and automated staging deployment.",
          "Advanced": "The pipeline includes automated production monitoring for model performance, data drift, and latency with automated alerting.",
          "Transformational": "We utilize fully automated, containerized deployment with automated rollbacks/shadow deployment and A/B testing capabilities managed by the MLOps platform."

        "3": {
          "Initial": "AI outputs are only used occasionally, typically as background reports or in isolated proof-of-concepts.",
          "Adopting": "AI provides insights that human operators may review but are not mandatory for proceeding with a task.",
          "Established": "In key processes (e.g., sales, scheduling), AI-generated recommendations are presented as the default action, requiring a human override to reject.",
          "Advanced": "AI decisions are automatically executed in some non-critical workflows (e.g., inventory restocking) without direct human intervention.",
          "Transformational": "AI models operate in a tight feedback loop where human overrides are automatically captured and used to retrain/fine-tune the model, continuously improving performance."
